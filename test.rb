hello world

are you there?
anybody?
I am just typing here to see anyone noticed.
Everybody is going to get food, I just wondering should I go too?
Chaomian and fir-rice is not real chinese food, but I would eat it if I am hungry~
when can we go home?
I am going to keep doing it until it become instint. I mean using github.
we are going to talk about branching in github, yay!
OK, if nobody noticed then I will make this as a secert dairy for this cohort...
